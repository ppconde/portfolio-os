          I began my professional journey at <strong>Altice Labs</strong>, a
          company dedicated to creating innovative solutions for the
          telecommunications and IT sectors. During my time there, I was part

          product features, debugging systems, and writing technical

          problem-solving skills and collaborate on impactful projects.
