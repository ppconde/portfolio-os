            I joined <strong>Blip.pt</strong>, where I deepened my technical
            expertise and worked with a broad range of technologies, including{' '}
            <em>
              GraphQL, Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, React, Webpack, Jest,
              Redux
            </em>
            , and <em>Docker</em>. I contributed to unit and functional testing,
            and I planned and developed features for multiple apps catering to
            betting brands. This role not only expanded my technical skill set
            but also gave me the chance to work on complex systems and deliver
            value to end-users.

            I began my professional journey at <strong>Altice Labs</strong>, a
            company dedicated to creating innovative solutions for the
            telecommunications and IT sectors. During my time there, I was part
            of the Operations Support System team, where I gained valuable
            experience in organizing and planning XML workflows, developing
            product features, debugging systems, and writing technical
            specifications. It was a great opportunity to hone my
            problem-solving skills and collaborate on impactful projects.
